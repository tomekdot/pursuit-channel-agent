# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

> Note: this repository is currently released as `v1.0.0`. Adjust the
> supported-versions table above if you publish newer releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this project,
please do NOT open a public GitHub issue. Instead follow one of these
private reporting channels so we can triage the report safely.

Preferred reporting options (in order):

1. GitHub Security Advisories — open a private security advisory on this
   repository (recommended). Use the "Security" → "Advisories" tab and
   choose "Create a security advisory". This keeps the report private and
   allows coordinated disclosure.

2. Email (PGP): send an encrypted message to `security@EXAMPLE.COM` with
   details and reproduction steps. **Replace `security@EXAMPLE.COM` with
   a real contact address before publishing this file.** If you use
   email, please include:
   - Affected version(s) and environment details
   - Minimal reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept
   - Expected and actual behaviour
   - Any relevant logs or stack traces

3. If neither option above is available, create a private GitHub issue
   and mark it as sensitive, then notify the maintainers via the
   repository's maintainers contact method.

Please do not post vulnerability details publicly (including social media
or public GitHub issues) until a fix has been released or a coordinated
disclosure timeline has been agreed.

## What to expect

- Acknowledgement within 3 business days.
- Triage and next-steps (fix, mitigation, or request for more info) within
  7 business days.
- If a fix is required, we will make a best-effort plan and publish an
  advisory, including a CVE request where applicable.

If we are unable to reach agreement on disclosure or a fix, we will
explain the rationale and suggested mitigations.

## Reporting PGP key (optional)

If you prefer to encrypt sensitive details by PGP, include our PGP public
key here. Replace the placeholder below with a real key before use:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
<PGP KEY PLACEHOLDER>
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Timeline and coordinated disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process. After a fix is prepared we
will coordinate a disclosure date that gives downstream users and package
managers reasonable time to apply patches.

If you'd like, I can update this file to include a real contact email or
PGP key and translate any parts to English as well. Tell me the contact
email you want published (or confirm you want to use GitHub Security
Advisories only), and any other details to include.
